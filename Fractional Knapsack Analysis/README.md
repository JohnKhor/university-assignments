# Fractional Knapsack Analysis
# Question
Implement the fractional knapsack algorithm using heap-based priority queue. This implemented program should cover the following aspects:

1. Correct implementation of heap-based priority queue. Your program must automatically generate the items with random benefits and random weight. Your program must allow user to specify the number of items to generate, and the maximum weight of the knapsack. The output must include
the selected items, its portions, its benefits, its weights, its value, and total benefits. [7m]
2. Run your program for different cases (best, average & worst) [3m]
3. In your report, show your experiment results in graphs (running time vs input size). [3m]
4. Conclude your findings in the report. [3m]
5. Presentation. [4m]

# Instruction
To compile: 
```
g++ -std=c++11 PriorityQueue.cpp main.cpp
```
Or run `build.bat` for Windows user. \
Alternatively, run `FractionalKnapsack.cbp` using CodeBlocks.
