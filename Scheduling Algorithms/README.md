# Scheduling Algorithms
# Algorithms Implemented
* First Come First Served-based Pre-emptive Priority (Kia Kin)
* Round Robin Scheduling (Chin Ann)
* Three-level Queue Scheduling (Kirthi)
* Shortest Remaining Time Next Scheduling (Kia Kin)

# Instructions
Python 2 is used.

## Running Three-level Queue
```
python tlq_main.py
```

## Running Others
If a CSV file is given:
```
python main.py process1.csv
```
Else:
```
python main.py
```
